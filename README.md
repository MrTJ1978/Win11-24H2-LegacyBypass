# Windows 11 24H2 Legacy Bypass - Official Discovery

This repository contains the official discovery for bypassing Windows 11 24H2 installation restrictions on Legacy BIOS (MBR) systems.

## Discoverer:
**Touraj Khoshakhlagh (MrTJ1978)**

## Reference Code:
**TJ-20250428-LEGACY-01**

## Description:
With the release of Windows 11 version 24H2, Microsoft introduced stricter hardware requirements (TPM 2.0, Secure Boot, supported CPUs) for installation.  
However, installation on older systems using Legacy BIOS caused persistent errors even after applying Microsoft's official registry bypass methods.

**Discovery:**  
By applying the registry bypass (LabConfig) exactly *before* clicking "Install Now" in Windows Setup, the bypass persists correctly, and installation succeeds on Legacy systems.
